<Location with-held due to contract>,DarkWLight,"City EOC: Just a reminder that dispatching crews to a particular neighborhood does not mean the problem will be solved in a matter of hours. Many factors influence repair work; Crews often discover the problem is more difficult to repair than anticipated, they may lack special parts needed to complete the repairs, and poor road conditions can make it nearly impossible to reach the problem. #GreatCrewsWonder",8,road,2020-04-09 00:30:00,32
